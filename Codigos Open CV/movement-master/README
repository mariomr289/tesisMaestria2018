Movement is a simple interactive game which uses images captured from user's
webcam.
The goal is to get as much red balls as you can while it falls from screen.

The game was written in Python using OpenCV framework and helps to demonstrate
how to use Python+OpenCV to capture user's webcam and make a game of it.

To run the game you must have python's opencv module installed. On most linux
distributions you can achieve that by simply installing opencv package (which
will also install python modules). If that's not the case, try installing
through pip (pip install pyopencv)
